# snoozed-todos

Personal list of To-Dos (as GitHub issues) currently blocked by external issues.

Uses the [SnoozeThis](https://github.com/marketplace/snoozethis)
GitHub Marketplace app for notifications (hence the name).

Obviously only tracks cases in which neither project is my own,
otherwise I'd just add the `@SnoozeThis` comment to the issue
directly.
